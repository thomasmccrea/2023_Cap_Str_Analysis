This was the R file used for analyizing market data up to 2023 to examine Sector importance on Dividends and Leverage.
This file is disorganized even with comments as it was soley used for my needs when writing two corresponding papers. 
To run this code and produce results, it is essential to have the corresponding excel files I have included in the repository.
These excel files include the final dataset I used generated from FactSet. There are some artifacts of code that use similarly named files that are not included. 
These seperate files are unnecessary. All relevantly used code works with datasets provided.
The end product of this code is to produce statistical analysis of both dividend yields and various debt ratios grouped by GICS sectors, to see if sectors are a significant predictor over any of the interested metrics. 
Beyond a tukey test and its requirements, this code will also condense 25 years of historical empirical data into heat maps to visualize trend data.
